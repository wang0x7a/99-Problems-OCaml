(* Problem:
 * Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists
 * 
 * a) We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves. 
 *    The objective is to sort the elements of this list according to their
 *    length. E.g., short lists first, longer lists later, or vice versa.
 *
 * b) Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists 
 *    themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the elements of this 
 *    list according to their length frequency; i.e., in the default, where 
 *    sorting is done ascendingly, lists with rare length are placedfirst, 
 *    others with a more frequent length come later.
