99 Problems (solved) in OCaml
============================

Practice makes perfect!

This repo tracks my solutions to the 99 Lisp Problems[1] solved in OCaml, and the problems are also part of the OCaml tutorials in ocaml.org[2]. 

I guarantee the originality of my solutions in this repo, and I will refer to existing solutions by VictorNicollet[3] to improve mine. Sincere thanks to VictorNicollet, without whose contribution, I would not find such a good way learn OCaml.
