(* Problem 55:
 * Construct completely balanced binary trees
 *
 * In a completely balanced binary tree, the following property holds for
 * every node: The number of nodes in its left subtree and the number of
 * nodes in its right subtree are almost equal, which means their
 * difference is not greater than one.
 *
 * Write a function #cbal_tree# to construct completely balanced bianry
 * trees for a given number of nodes. The function should generate all 
 * solutions iva backtracing. Put 'x' as information into all nodes of
 * the tree.
